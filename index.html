            <h2>🌟 What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
            <p class="simple-explanation">
                Imagine you want to play with toys, but you don't have space at home to keep all of them. 
                Instead, you go to a toy library where you can borrow any toy you want, play with it, 
                and return it when you're done. You only pay for the time you use the toys!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cloud computing is like that toy library, but for computers!</strong> Instead of buying 
                expensive computers and keeping them in your office, you "borrow" computer power from the internet 
                whenever you need it. You can use a little or a lot, and you only pay for what you use.
            </p>

        <!-- What is Azure Section -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>🔷 What is Microsoft Azure?</h2>
            <p class="simple-explanation">
                Think of Azure as a giant playground in the cloud owned by Microsoft. This playground has 
                lots of different areas: some for storing your stuff, some for running programs, and some 
                for keeping your things safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> is a cloud platform that provides over 200 different services. 
                It's like a huge toolbox where businesses can find tools to build websites, store data, 
                run applications, and much more - all without owning physical computers!

                    <h3>💰 Save Money</h3>
                    <p>You don't need to buy expensive computers. Just pay for what you use, like paying for electricity!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit-item">
                    <h3>📈 Grow Easily</h3>

        <!-- Cloud Service Types Section -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>🏗️ Types of Cloud Services</h2>
            
            <div class="service-type">
                <h3>🍕 IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service</h3>
                <p class="simple-explanation">
                    Imagine ordering a pizza with just the dough and sauce. You add your own toppings at home!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With IaaS, you get the basic computer stuff (like storage and servers), but YOU decide 
                    what to install and how to use it. <strong>Example:</strong> Azure Virtual Machines.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-type">
                <h3>🍕 PaaS - Platform as a Service</h3>
                <p class="simple-explanation">
                    This is like ordering a pizza that's already made, but you can still add extra cheese if you want!
                </p>
                <p>
                    PaaS gives you a ready-to-use platform where you can build and run your apps without 
                    worrying about the computer underneath. <strong>Example:</strong> Azure App Service.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-type">
                <h3>🍕 SaaS - Software as a Service</h3>
                <p class="simple-explanation">
                    This is like going to a pizza restaurant - everything is ready, you just sit and eat!
                </p>
                <p>
                    SaaS is ready-to-use software that you access through the internet. You don't install 
                    anything! <strong>Example:</strong> Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel online).
                </p>

        <!-- Core Azure Services Section -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>🛠️ Important Azure Services</h2>
            
            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>💻 Virtual Machines</h3>
                <p>Like having a computer in the cloud that you can turn on and off whenever you want!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>📦 Storage Accounts</h3>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>🌐 App Service</h3>

            <div class="service-item">
                <h3>🔐 Azure Active Directory</h3>
                <p>The security guard that checks if you're allowed to enter - it manages who can access what.</p>

        </section>

        <!-- Pricing Section -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>💵 How Does Azure Pricing Work?</h2>
            <p class="simple-explanation">
                Remember the toy library? You pay based on how long you play with the toys. Azure is the same!
            </p>
            <p>
                Azure uses <strong>"Pay-As-You-Go"</strong> pricing. This means:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You only pay for what you actually use</li>
                <li>If you use more, you pay more. If you use less, you pay less!</li>
                <li>No need to buy expensive equipment upfront</li>
                <li>You can use the <strong>Azure Pricing Calculator</strong> to estimate costs before you start</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Regions Section -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>🌍 Azure Regions</h2>
            <p class="simple-explanation">
                Imagine Microsoft has toy libraries in different cities around the world. You can choose 
                the one closest to you so you can get your toys faster!
            </p>
            <p>
                Azure has <strong>data centers</strong> (big buildings full of computers) in many countries. 
                These locations are called <strong>regions</strong>. You can choose which region to use, 
                and it's usually best to pick one close to your users for faster performance!
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Support Section -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>🆘 Azure Support</h2>
            <p>
                Microsoft offers different levels of help, like having different types of helpers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic:</strong> Free! Like asking a friend for help.</li>
